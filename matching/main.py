"""The Lore — Matching API.

This is the backend service the UI talks to. Run locally with:
    uvicorn main:app --reload
Then open http://localhost:8000/docs for an interactive API explorer.

Endpoints (all return JSON):

    POST /match
        Find the skills that best match a user's query.
        Body:    { "query": "summarize my meeting", "top_k": 10 }
                 - query  (string, required): what the user typed
                 - top_k  (int, optional, default 10): how many results to return
        Returns: [
            { "skill": { ...skill fields... }, "score": 0.87 },
            ...
        ]
        Note: "vector" is stripped from each skill before returning.

    GET /skills
        Return every skill in the catalog (for a browse/landing view).
        Returns: [ { ...skill fields... }, ... ]

    GET /skills/{id}
        Return the full data for one skill, looked up by its "id".
        Example: GET /skills/summarize-meeting-notes
        Returns: { ...skill fields... }    (404 if id not found)
